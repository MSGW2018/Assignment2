# Assignment2: Analysis of websites covering current events
Assignment 1 is the first assignment for Unit 1.

## Description
During UNIT 1 we have seen the concept of the web, types of sites we can find on the web and their main features, the W3C and web spaces covering current events.

The aim of this assignment is to deepen the analysis of the **websites covering current events**. Specifically, each group must analyse three websites covering current events. For that, each group must follow these phases:

- **Choose three websites covering current events**. Looking for websites with notable differences between each other is advised, so that the comparison is richer.
- **Design the methodology** to analyse the websites. Aspects, criteria, features etc. to take into account must be defined, in order to perform the analysis. The readings can serve as reference and starting point.
- Carry out the analysis and **write a report**.
- Create a **piece of news in an online format** about the contents of the report.

## Conditions for submission
Each group must submit the URL of a website in which all the produced contents can be accessed. This web space must include a piece of news with information about the report, the analysis report itself and the design of the methodology. Different formats can be combined (written text, audio, pictures, videos...).
